# RPG-Arithmetic
A few files meant to help with action-RPG development.

Hi, if you're looking at this, I'd like to start by saying... Hi, how are ya?

I'm no Game Developer, In fact im SO fresh to programming and game development that by the time im writing this file (Sep. 24, 2025) I've only been in college for Comp Sci. for a little over a month!
But these files are meant to practice Python with the guise of creating an RPG,and eventually I intend on using these files as the basis for an actual game, probably a bad one but maybe it'll be decent.
I hope in a few years when I look back on this repository I can realize I was total ass today, but improved tomorrow
Anywho see ya around!
